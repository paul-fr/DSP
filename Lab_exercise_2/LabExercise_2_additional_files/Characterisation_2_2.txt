d) The amplitude responses of the thwo channels of the measurement system are very similar to one another. The difference is that channel 1 has an overall gain of 3 dB compared to channel 2. The cutoff frequencies are at 16.8 Hz and 16.263 kHz. Therefore the Q factor is approx. 0.5. It is a second order active bandpass filter with a bandwith of 16.246 kHz.


e) The amplitude responses of the two channels of the DUT look similar despite a drop off at low frequencies for channel 1. The phase responses on the otherhand are very different. The phase of channel 2 stays more or less 0 with deviation between +-0.5 in the area of high amplification whereas channel 1 experiences a linear phase roatation over the complete spectrum. The spectrum could be best described as an all-pass filter with gain of 0 dB cascaded with an active bandpass filter with a gain of approx. 9 dB. The center frequency of the latter is approx. 6 kHz with a bandwidth of 2.821 kHz (f_cl = 4.7068 kHz f_cu = 7.5286 kHz). the Q factor therefor is about 2.13. The phase response of channel 2 could be the result of a phase compensation. That means the filter order has to be 4. The group delay for channel 1 is constantly -0.0005 s whereas the group delay for channel 2 changes in the lower frequency band. The filter needs to be non-causal to have positive group delay. Negative values for group delay mean in this case actual delays. So positive values mean there is an output before the stimulation occurs.
